            <p>Voyagery (the “Company”) is committed to maintaining robust privacy protections for its users.  Our Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Service. </p> 

            <p>For purposes of this Agreement, “Site” refers to the Company’s website, which can be accessed at https://voyagery.com. “Service” refers to the Company’s services accessed via the Site, in which users can post user-generated content including file uploads. The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the Company. “You” refers to you, as a user of our Site or our Service. </p>

            <p>By accessing our Site or our Service, you accept our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use (found here: https://voyagery.com/terms), and you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h2>I. Information we collect</h2>

            <p>We collect “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information.” Non-Personal Information includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may collect, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks. Personal Information includes your name and email address, which you submit to us through the account registration process at the Site. The legal basis in collecting Personal Information is our legitimate interest in managing your account and contacting you.</p>

            <p>When you become a registered user or subscribe to our marketing messages, we collect personal data about you such as your name, email address, and password. We use this information to allow you to manage your account, send marketing messages, respond to your requests or to help improve our site. </p>

            <p>When you subscribe to our Premium plan, we collect additional personal information such as credit card details and physical address. This information is required by our payment processing provider to confirm and make payment for your Premium subscription. This data is collected by us but passed to our third-party payment processing provider, Stripe Inc, where it is stored securely on their servers. Payment data is not stored on our servers. For information on how Stripe Inc processes and collects personal information, please refer to the privacy policy on their website, https://stripe.com.</p>


            <h3>1.   Information collected via Technology</h3>

            <p>In an effort to improve the quality of the Service, we track information provided to us by your browser or by our software application when you view or use the Service, such as the website you came from (known as the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, the device from which you connected to the Service, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you. We track this information using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a user’s browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal information about that user and keep a record of the user’s preferences when utilising our services, both on an individual and aggregate basis. </p>

            <p>The Company may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser.  </p>

            <h3>2.   Information you provide us by registering for an account</h3>

            <p>In addition to the information provided automatically by your browser when you visit the Site, to use the Service you will need to create a personal account. You can create an account by registering with the Service and providing your name, email address and password. By registering, you are authorising us to collect, store and use this personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h3>3. Children’s Privacy</h3>

            <p>The Site and the Service are not directed to anyone under the age of 13. The Site does not knowingly collect or solicit information from anyone under the age of 13, or allow anyone under the age of 13 to sign up for the Service. In the event that we learn that we have gathered personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without the consent of a parent or guardian, we will delete that information as soon as possible. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us at info@voyagery.com. </p>

            <h2>II. How we use and share information</h2>

            <h3>Personal Information:</h3>

            <p>Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share for marketing purposes your Personal Information with third parties without your consent. We do share Personal Information with vendors who are performing services for the Company, such as the servers for our email communications who are provided access to the user’s email address for purposes of sending emails from us. Those vendors use your Personal Information only at our direction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>We may share Personal Information with outside parties if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable legal process or enforceable governmental request; to enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations; address fraud, security or technical concerns; or to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public as required or permitted by law. </p>

            <h3>Non-Personal Information:</h3>

            <p>In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service and customise the user experience. We also aggregate Non-Personal Information in order to track trends and analyse use patterns on the Site. </p>

            <p>In the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of our assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at any time in the future, we will post the policy changes to the Site so that you may opt out of the new information practices. We suggest that you check the Site periodically if you are concerned about how your information is used.</p>

            <h2>III. How we protect information</h2>

            <p>We implement security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorised access. Your account is protected by your account password and we urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe by not disclosing your password and by logging out of your account after each use. We further protect your information from potential security breaches by implementing certain technological security measures including encryption, firewalls and secure socket layer technology. However, these measures do not guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. By using our Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.</p>

            <h2>IV. Your rights regarding the use of your personal information</h2>

            <p>Under data protection law, you have rights regarding the use of your personal information including: </p>

            <uL class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Your right of access - you have the right to ask for copies of your personal information.</li>
                <li>Your right to rectification - You have the right to ask us to rectify personal information you think is inaccurate.</li> 
                <li>Your right to erasure - You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information in certain circumstances.</li>
                <li>Your right to restriction of processing - You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances.</li>
                <li>Your right to object to processing -     You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances.</li>
                <li>Your right to data portability - You have the right to ask that we transfer the personal information you gave us to another organisation, or you, in certain circumstances.</li>
            </uL>

            <p>For example, you have the right at any time to prevent us from contacting you for marketing purposes.  When we send a promotional communication to you, you can opt out of further promotional communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each promotional email. Please note that notwithstanding the promotional preferences you indicate by unsubscribing, we may continue to send you administrative emails including, for example, periodic updates to our Privacy Policy. You can also request to delete all personal data we hold by selecting the option to do so in your account settings. However, if you have an existing subscription the portion of time not used following account deletion is non-refundable.</p>

            <h2>V. Links to other websites</h2>

            <p>As part of the Service, we may provide links to or compatibility with other websites or applications. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those websites or the information or content they contain. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Site and the Service. Therefore, this Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of a third party website accessed by selecting a link on our Site or via our Service. To the extent that you access or use the Service through or on another website or application, then the privacy policy of that other website or application will apply to your access or use of that site or application. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of other websites before proceeding to use them.</p>

            <h2>VI. Changes to our privacy policy</h2>

Significant changes will go into effect 30 days following such notification. Non-material changes or clarifications will take effect immediately. You should periodically check the Site and this privacy page for updates.</p>
